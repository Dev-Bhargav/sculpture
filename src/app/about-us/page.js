        Celebrating the Art of Timeless Sculpture
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
        At <strong>Desgin Wizards</strong>, we believe every sculpture tells a story — carved not just in stone or clay, but in history, culture, and human expression. Our platform is dedicated to showcasing the intricate beauty and craftsmanship behind traditional and contemporary sculptural works.

      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        In a world of fast-paced digital content, sculpture reminds us to slow down and appreciate depth — the roughness of stone, the fluidity of form, and the patience it takes to create something timeless.
